Tools for Decoding Neuron Network in A Dish

New Techniques allows scientists to generate neurons in the plates and model mental disorders in a dish (Diseases In A Dish). Multielectrode arrays (MEAs) connect neurons to electronic circuitry, record the ion currents of neurons and enable us to study the neuron’s activities in neuronal cell culture.
By using the MEA recording data, we’ve developed some tools to study propagation signals along neuron axons (pre-synaptic signals). We identified the loci of axons, calculated the conduction velocity, explored axon branches and sizes, and simplify the neuron organizations in the well.
Neurons use synapses to pass signal and form networks. We also studied synaptic coupling and identified the connections between neurons. Together with the data of pre-synaptic signals, we can decode the neuron network in each well, compare the neuronal activity, network connectivity and network activity between samples.
